In this code file I build functions in a terminal that can be called:

hashmapBuilder() - will build a hashmap
linkedlistBuilder() - will build a linked linkedlistBuilder
stackBuilder() - will build a stack data structure
queueBuilder() - will build a queue data structure
treeBuilder() - will build a tree data structure
